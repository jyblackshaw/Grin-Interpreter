# Grin Interpreter

The Grin Interpreter project is a Python-based application that interprets programs written in the Grin language. It reads and processes Grin statements from standard input, executes them according to their defined behaviors, and manages input-output interactions. The interpreter handles various types of statements, error conditions, and program states during execution. 

## Project Functionality

The Grin interpreter project involves creating an interpreter for the Grin language. Key functionalities encompass:

### Grin Statement Handling

- **Input Interpretation:**
  - Read and interpret Grin statements from standard input.
  - Recognize the end-of-program marker.

- **Error Management:**
  - Print clear error messages for parsing and runtime errors.

- **Program Execution:**
  - Execute Grin statements and manage input/output.

- **Runtime Error Handling:**
  - Handle runtime errors and display informative error messages.

- **Output Control:**
  - Ensure minimal output, generated by Grin statements.

## Design Requirements

The design adheres to key principles:

- **Modular Approach:**
  - Leverage modules within the `grin` package for effective code organization.

- **Separation of Concerns:**
  - Isolate distinct concerns into separate modules for enhanced code manageability.

- **Object-Oriented Paradigm:**
  - Utilize object-oriented programming principles, including classes and inheritance.

## Core Concepts

The interpreter is built upon fundamental concepts:

1. **Grin Statements:**
   - Different types of statements in a Grin program with specific execution behaviors.

2. **Data Types:**
   - Support for integers, floats, and strings as fundamental data types.

3. **Control Flow:**
   - Handling control flow statements like GOTO and GOSUB, involving line numbers and relational operators.

4. **Program State:**
   - Tracking program state, including executing line number, labels, variable values, and GOSUB remembered line numbers.

## Getting Started

To utilize the Grin interpreter, follow the instructions below:

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
3. Open the project in an appropriate IDE (e.g., PyCharm).
4. Run the `project3.py` script to initiate the interpreter.
